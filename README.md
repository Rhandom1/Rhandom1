- I taught Theatre for three years before the pandemic. While schools were closed, I continued to direct shows virtually and joined a coding bootcamp. I rediscovered my passion for coding and have really enjoyed the journey! I look forward learning more and gaining much needed experience while using my leadership, communication, and collaboration skills to help my team succeed!
